# c_base64

A small reimplementation of encoding strings into Base64.

## Building

Just run `make` within this folder, and the `Makefile` should generate a binary.

## Note

Don't use this for anything important, there will be bugs. This was made to suppliment
my own learning and understanding of how Base64 encoding works.
